+          ✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - ALL TESTS PASSED
+          
+          Tested GET /api/routes/{route_id}/details endpoint:
+          
+          1. ✅ Waypoint Creation: Successfully created multiple waypoints via POST /api/waypoints
+          2. ✅ Route Creation: Successfully created routes with 2+ waypoints via POST /api/routes
+          3. ✅ Route Details Retrieval: GET /api/routes/{route_id}/details returns correct data structure
+          4. ✅ Response Structure: Verified all required fields present (id, name, waypoints, total_distance_nm, description, created_at)
+          5. ✅ Distance Calculation: Haversine formula calculates accurate distances between waypoints
+             - 2-waypoint route: Expected 1.0533 nm, Actual 1.0533 nm (0.000000 nm difference)
+             - 3-waypoint route: Expected 3.9572 nm, Actual 3.9572 nm (perfect match)
+          6. ✅ Error Handling - Invalid ID: Returns 400 Bad Request for malformed route IDs
+          7. ✅ Error Handling - Non-existent ID: Returns 404 Not Found for valid but non-existent route IDs
+          8. ✅ Waypoint Details: Full waypoint objects returned with id, name, lat, lon, description, created_at
+          
+          All test scenarios from review request completed successfully.
+          Backend implementation is production-ready.

+      ✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
+      
+      Created comprehensive test suite in /app/backend_test.py
+      
+      Test Results:
+      - ✅ Backend health check: PASSED
+      - ✅ Route details endpoint: PASSED (all scenarios)
+      - ✅ Multiple waypoints route: PASSED
+      
+      Key Findings:
+      1. GET /api/routes/{route_id}/details endpoint is fully functional
+      2. Distance calculation using haversine formula is accurate (0.000000 nm difference)
+      3. Error handling is robust (400 for invalid IDs, 404 for non-existent routes)
+      4. Response structure matches requirements exactly
+      5. Waypoint details are correctly populated
+      6. Works correctly with 2+ waypoints
+      
+      Backend implementation is production-ready. No issues found.
+      
+      Frontend testing was NOT performed as per system instructions (frontend testing requires user approval).
